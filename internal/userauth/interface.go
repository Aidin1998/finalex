// This file intentionally left mostly empty as we're using the concrete Service type
// directly from service.go instead of through an interface.
//
// The Service type defined in service.go should be used directly by clients.

// LEGACY/DEPRECATED: This file is not needed for the enterprise model and can be safely deleted.
