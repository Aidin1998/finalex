# Pincex Crypto Exchange - Full Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the complete architecture for the Pincex crypto exchange platform, designed to be production-ready with high-performance trading capabilities. The architecture preserves the existing high-performance matching engine while adding all necessary components for a complete exchange.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Unified codebase with clear separation of concerns
2. **Microservices Within Monolith**: Modular services that can be deployed together or separately
3. **High Performance**: Optimized for 3000-7000 matches per second
4. **Scalability**: Support for unlimited trading pairs (up to 5000 currencies)
5. **Security**: Comprehensive authentication, authorization, and encryption
6. **Extensibility**: Well-defined APIs for third-party integrations
7. **Observability**: Logging, metrics, and tracing throughout the system

1. User initiates deposit via API
2. Payment processor or wallet system handles funds
3. Deposit verification performed
4. Funds credited to user account
5. Notifications sent to user
6. Transaction recorded in history

### Withdrawal Flow

1. User requests withdrawal
2. 2FA verification performed
3. Compliance checks executed
4. Withdrawal processed through wallet system or payment processor
5. Funds debited from user account
6. Notifications sent to user
7. Transaction recorded in history

## Integration Points
