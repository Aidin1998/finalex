# Test Coverage Gap Analysis

## Modules with No or Insufficient Test Coverage

### 1. Settlement
- **Files:** confirmation_api.go, engine.go, settlement_processor.go
- **Gap:** No unit, integration, or E2E tests found for settlement logic, confirmation flows, or processor edge cases.

### 2. Wallet
- **Files:** evm_adapter.go, provider.go, service.go
- **Gap:** No unit, integration, or E2E tests for wallet operations, provider integration, or EVM adapter logic.

### 3. Scaling
- **Files:** controller/, features/, integration/, predictor/, training/
- **Gap:** No tests found for scaling logic, prediction, or training modules.

### 4. Consensus
- **Files:** partition_detector.go, raft_coordinator.go, recovery_manager.go, split_brain_resolver.go
- **Gap:** No tests for consensus, partition detection, raft coordination, or recovery/failover logic.

### 5. Bookkeeper (Partial)
- **Files:** service.go
- **Gap:** Only partial coverage; ensure all bookkeeper operations, edge cases, and error handling are tested.

### 6. Market Data
- **Files:** backpressure/, enhanced_hub.go, fix_gateway.go, kafka_fallback.go
- **Gap:** No explicit tests for backpressure, enhanced hub, FIX gateway, or Kafka fallback logic.

### 7. Other Potential Gaps
- **Compliance, KYC, Manipulation, Monitoring, Coordination, etc.:** Review for missing or insufficient tests, especially for new features or critical paths.

## Recently Closed Gaps
- WebSocket client integration test is now robust and passing.
- Backpressure manager unit test is robust and passing, with all dependencies mocked or nil-safe.

## Remaining Gaps
- Advanced/edge-case scenarios for market data (e.g., high-frequency, burst, disconnect/reconnect, malformed messages).
- Performance/benchmark tests for WebSocket and backpressure modules.
- Scaling and consensus module tests (skeletons exist, need implementation and coverage).

## Next Focus
- Implement and run advanced/edge-case and performance tests for market data and backpressure.
- Continue to flesh out scaling and consensus module tests.

## Next Steps
- Prioritize writing new tests for settlement, wallet, scaling, and consensus modules.
- Add advanced/edge-case tests for market data (backpressure, enhanced hub, FIX, Kafka fallback).
- Continue reviewing other modules for gaps and update this file as new gaps are found or filled.
- Focus on implementing and testing the settlement module as the next priority.

## Market Data
- WebSocket client/server integration: Covered by websocket_client_test.go (basic subscribe/receive). Edge/advanced cases (backpressure, enhanced hub, FIX, Kafka fallback) still pending.

## Settlement
- Processor unit test now passing in internal/settlement. Edge/negative cases still pending.

## Next Priority
- Advanced/edge-case tests for market data (backpressure, enhanced hub, FIX, Kafka fallback).
