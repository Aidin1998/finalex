# PinCEX Unified Exchange â€“ Comprehensive Load & Performance Testing Report

## 1. Overview
This document details the methodology, scenarios, infrastructure, results, and recommendations for rigorous load and performance testing of the PinCEX Unified Exchange. The goal is to validate system stability, latency, throughput, and resource utilization under extreme and bursty loads.

- **Resource Monitoring:**
  - Node-level: CPU, RAM, disk I/O, network (Prometheus node_exporter)
  - Pod-level: Application metrics, error rates, latency (custom + Prometheus)
- **Test Scripts:**
  - All scripts and scenarios are in `test/load/` and `test/perf/`.

- **Ramp-up:** 10 minutes to full load
- **Data:** Synthetic, randomized, production-like

### 5.2 Traffic Spike
- **k6 script:** `test/load/spike_150k_tps.js`
- **Locust scenario:** `test/load/locust_spike.py`
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Ramp-up:** 2 minutes to spike, 2 minutes down

## 7. Observations & Failure Modes
- **Sustained Load:**
  - System remained stable, minor latency increases during DB checkpointing.
  - No significant error spikes; resource usage within safe margins.
- **Spike:**
  - Latency and error rates increased, but no critical failures.
  - Some order queue backpressure observed; auto-scaling triggered as expected.
  - No data loss or unrecoverable errors.

---

## 8. Recommendations

- **Database:**
  - Consider further partitioning and connection pool tuning for >150k TPS.
  - Monitor checkpoint/compaction impact on latency.
- **Matching Engine:**
  - Optimize for burst handling (queue size, thread pool tuning).
  - Pre-warm additional matching engine instances before known spikes.
- **API Layer:**
  - Enable adaptive rate limiting to protect core services during spikes.
- **Resource Scaling:**
  - Increase node pool size for >90% sustained CPU/RAM.
  - Use predictive scaling based on traffic patterns.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Set up alerting for p99 latency and error rate thresholds.
