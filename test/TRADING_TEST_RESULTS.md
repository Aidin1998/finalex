# Trading Engine Test Results

## Test Setup

We've configured the trading tests to:

1. Use mock data instead of requiring a real database
2. Run 100,000 orders through the matching engine
3. Test both heap-based and B-tree-based matching implementations
4. Collect performance metrics for matching operations/second

## Test Files

The following key test files have been configured:

- `trading_integration_test.go`: Tests the core trading functionality with high volume order matching (heap-based)
- `trading_benchmarks_test.go`: Benchmarks for trading engine operations
- `trading_performance_test.go`: Performance tests for high volume order placement
- `trading_stress_load_test.go`: Stress tests with concurrent order processing
- `trading_edge_cases_test.go`: Tests edge cases and error handling

## Matching Engine Implementations

The codebase includes two different matching engine implementations:

1. **Heap-based Matching Engine** (`orderbook.go`):
   - Uses a `PriceHeap` data structure for O(1) best price access and O(log n) insert/remove
   - Price levels are maintained in heaps (max-heap for bids, min-heap for asks)

2. **B-tree-based Matching Engine** (`orderbook_safe.go`):
   - Uses Google's `btree` package for price level organization
   - Provides O(log n) operations with better constant factors for larger order books

## Running the Tests

We've created several scripts to run the tests:

1. `Run-HighVolumeTradingTests.ps1/.cmd` - Runs high volume tests with 100K orders
2. `Run-AllTradingTests.ps1/.cmd` - Runs all trading tests sequentially
3. `run_high_volume_tests.sh` - Bash script for Linux/Mac environments

## Performance Metrics

The tests are configured to report:

- Orders/second processing rate
- Matching operations/second
- Success rate for order placement

The minimum expected performance is 100 TPS (transactions per second).

## Usage

To run the high volume trading tests:

```bash
# Windows
.\Run-HighVolumeTradingTests.cmd

# Linux/Mac
./run_high_volume_tests.sh
```

To run all trading tests:

```bash
# Windows
.\Run-AllTradingTests.cmd
```
