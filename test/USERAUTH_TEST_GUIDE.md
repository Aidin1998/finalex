# UserAuth Module Test Suite Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the UserAuth module test suite, including structure, testing strategies, and recommendations for improvements.

## Test Suite Structure

The UserAuth test suite is organized into specialized test files that focus on different aspects of authentication functionality:

| Test File | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `userauth_2fa_test.go` | Tests for two-factor authentication features |
| `userauth_authentication_test.go` | Tests for core authentication flows |
| `userauth_registration_test.go` | Tests for user registration processes |
| `userauth_registration_validation_test.go` | Tests for input validation during registration |
| `userauth_stress_test.go` | Tests for high concurrency and load |
| `userauth_service_test.go` | Tests for the main Service struct |
| `userauth_integration_test.go` | End-to-end integration tests |
| `userauth_basic_test.go` | Basic tests to verify test infrastructure |
| `userauth_mocks.go` | Mock implementations of dependencies |

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Tests for individual components (services, functions)
- Focus on isolated business logic
- Extensive use of mocks for dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Tests for interactions between multiple components
- Verify workflows across service boundaries
- Use in-memory databases (SQLite) to test data persistence

### Stress Tests
- Tests for performance under high load
- Concurrent request handling
- Race condition detection
- Resource management under pressure

## Key Features Tested

### Authentication
- Token generation and validation
- Session management
- Password validation and hashing
- Refresh token flows
- API key authentication
- Permission checking

### Two-Factor Authentication
- TOTP secret generation
- Token verification
- Backup code management
- 2FA enforcement policies

### User Registration
- Input validation
- Duplicate detection (email, username)
- Password policy enforcement
- Compliance checks
- Country restrictions
- Required field validation

### Security & Compliance
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- PII encryption
- KYC integration
- Compliance checks

## Mocking Strategy

The test suite uses a combination of mock implementations:

1. **Interface Mocks** - Using the testify/mock package for interfaces
2. **Struct Mocks** - Custom implementations of required types
3. **In-Memory Databases** - SQLite for data persistence testing

### Key Mock Types

- `mockAuthService` - Authentication functions
- `mockRegistrationService` - Registration workflows
- `mock2FAService` - Two-factor authentication
- `mockEncryptionService` - PII encryption
- `mockComplianceService` - Regulatory compliance checks
- `mockAuditService` - Audit logging
- `mockTieredRateLimiter` - Rate limiting

## Common Test Setup Patterns

Most tests follow these setup patterns:

1. Create an in-memory SQLite database
2. Migrate necessary schemas
3. Initialize mocked dependencies
4. Create the service under test
5. Set up test data
6. Execute test cases
7. Verify results with assertions

## Fixed Issues in Test Suite

During the review and updates to the test suite, several issues were fixed:

1. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed references to userauth.EnterpriseRegistrationRequest and other types
2. **Missing Fields**: Updated struct field references to match actual implementation
3. **Undefined Constants**: Addressed references to undefined constants like ErrPasswordTooShort
4. **Interface Compatibility**: Ensured mock implementations match the signatures of actual interfaces
5. **Import Conflicts**: Resolved import issues between test files

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

### Test Coverage
- Add more edge cases for error handling
- Test failure recovery scenarios
- Test more invalid input combinations

### Stress Testing
- Increase concurrency levels in stress tests
- Add memory usage profiling
- Add CPU profiling under load
- Test database connection pool saturation

### Security Testing
- Add specific tests for common attack vectors
- Test rate limiting effectiveness
- Add fuzz testing for input validation

### Maintenance
- Add more comments to complex test scenarios
- Consider breaking larger test files into smaller ones
- Add test helpers for common setup tasks

## Running the Tests

Run the full test suite with:

```powershell
.\Run-UserAuth-Tests.ps1
```

Run individual test files with:

```powershell
go test -v -tags=userauth ./test -run TestXXX
```

## Performance Metrics Collection

The test suite collects key metrics during test runs:

- Test execution time
- Database query count
- Memory usage
- Authentication throughput
- Error rates
- Cache hit/miss rates

These are output to the `test_results` directory for analysis.
