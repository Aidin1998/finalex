# Trading Module Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the trading module, covering all aspects from API handlers to integration tests, performance tests, and edge cases.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Model validation and business logic
- Individual component functionality
- Repository and data access patterns
- Service layer operations

### 2. Integration Tests  
- Inter-module communication (accounts, compliance, risk)
- Database integration with proper transactions
- Event bus and messaging integration
- Settlement and clearing workflows

### 3. API Tests
- REST endpoint validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and error handling
- Rate limiting and throttling

### 4. Performance Tests
- High-frequency order placement (100k+ TPS)
- Concurrent user scenarios
- Memory and resource usage
- Latency measurements

### 5. Security Tests
- Input sanitization and injection prevention
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization boundary testing
- Audit logging verification

### 6. Edge Case Tests
- Network failures and timeouts
- Database connectivity issues
- Invalid data handling
- Race conditions and concurrency issues

## Test Data Management
- Isolated test databases
- Seed data for consistent testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean setup/teardown procedures

## Coverage Goals
- 95%+ code coverage for all non-engine components
- 100% API endpoint coverage
- Complete error path testing
- All integration points validated
