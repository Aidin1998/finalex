# Production Deployment & Rollout Plan

## 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- Ensure all modules pass integration and stress tests.
- Security audit (gosec, dependency checks).
- Confirm API keys and secrets are securely stored (see `security/security.go`).
- Validate monitoring and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, zap logs).
- Prepare Redis and database backups.

## 2. Deployment Steps
1. **Build Docker Image**
   - `docker build -t market-maker-bot:latest .`
2. **Push to Registry**
   - `docker tag ...` and `docker push ...`
3. **Update Kubernetes/Compose Manifests**
   - Set image tag, environment variables, secrets.
4. **Apply Manifests**
   - `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` or `docker-compose up -d`
5. **Run Database/Redis Migrations** (if needed)

## 3. Initial Monitoring Configuration
- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana (see `monitoring/metrics.go`).
- Import dashboards for:
  - Order latency
  - Trade volume
  - Orders/sec (stress test)
  - Anomaly alerts
- Set up alert rules for critical metrics (latency, error rate, failover events).

## 4. Rollback Procedures
- Use versioned Docker images for quick rollback.
- Rollback with `kubectl rollout undo deployment/market-maker-bot` or `docker-compose`.
- Restore Redis/database from latest backup if needed.
- Monitor system after rollback for stability.

## 5. Post-Deployment
- Monitor logs and metrics closely for 24-48 hours.
- Run additional stress and anomaly tests in production.
- Schedule regular security and performance reviews.

This plan ensures a safe, observable, and reversible rollout to production for the Market Maker Bot.
