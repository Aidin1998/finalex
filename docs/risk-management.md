## Configuration

The system is configured through `configs/risk-management.yaml`:

### Position Limits
```yaml
position_limits:
  default_user_limit: 100000
  default_market_limit: 1000000
  global_limit: 10000000
```

### Risk Calculation
```yaml
risk_calculation:
  var_confidence: 0.95
  var_time_horizon: 1
  calculation_timeout: 500ms
  batch_size: 100
```

### Compliance Settings
```yaml
compliance:
  aml:
    enabled: true
    daily_volume_threshold: 50000
    structuring_threshold: 10000
    velocity_threshold: 10
```

## Performance Requirements

The system is designed to meet strict performance requirements:

- **Sub-second Risk Calculations**: All risk calculations must complete within 500ms
- **100% Limit Enforcement**: Position limits must be enforced with zero tolerance
- **High Throughput**: Support 10,000+ operations per second
- **Low Latency**: P95 latency under 10ms for critical operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard updates within 5 seconds

## Testing

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
go test ./test/risk_management_integration_test.go -v

# Run performance benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkRiskCalculation ./test/risk_management_integration_test.go
```

### Test Coverage
- Position limit enforcement

- Batch processing performance
- Compliance rule execution
- Dashboard metrics
- Regulatory reporting
- API endpoint functionality
- End-to-end workflow validation

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- WebSocket support

### Environment Variables
```bash
export RISK_DB_CONNECTION="postgres://user:pass@localhost/risk_db"
export RISK_REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
export RISK_CONFIG_PATH="/etc/pincex/risk-management.yaml"
```

### Service Startup
```go
// Initialize risk service
config := risk.LoadConfig("risk-management.yaml")
riskService := risk.NewService(config, logger, db)

// Start service
err := riskService.Start()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to start risk service:", err)
}

// Graceful shutdown
defer riskService.Stop()
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- **Risk Calculation Latency**: P50, P95, P99 latencies
- **Position Limit Violations**: Count and severity
- **Compliance Alert Rate**: Alerts per hour/day
- **System Health**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **API Performance**: Request rate, error rate, response times

### Alert Thresholds
- Calculation latency > 500ms
- Position limit violations > 0
- Compliance alert rate > 10/hour
- System resource usage > 80%
- API error rate > 1%

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- API key authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Admin endpoints require 2FA
- Audit logging for all operations
- IP whitelisting for administrative access

### Compliance
- Data retention policies
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Regulatory reporting accuracy
- Audit trail maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Latency
1. Check database connection pool
2. Verify Redis connectivity
3. Monitor system resources
4. Review calculation batch sizes

#### Position Limit Failures
1. Check limit configuration
2. Verify user exemptions
3. Review market data freshness
4. Validate calculation logic

#### Compliance Alerts
1. Review rule parameters
2. Check transaction patterns
3. Validate alert thresholds
4. Verify rule execution logic

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Filter risk calculation logs
grep "risk_calculation" /var/log/pincex/app.log

# Monitor compliance alerts
grep "compliance_alert" /var/log/pincex/app.log

# Check performance metrics
grep "performance_metric" /var/log/pincex/app.log
```
