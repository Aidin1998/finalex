## Deployment Execution

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Run the pipeline test
./test-zero-downtime-pipeline.sh

# Validate current system health
./master-orchestrator.sh validate

# Check resource utilization
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods -n pincex-production
```

### Step 2: Backup Current State
```bash
# Backup configurations
./master-orchestrator.sh backup-config

# Create database snapshots (if applicable)
# Backup trading state and order books
# Document current feature flag states
```

### Step 3: Execute Deployment
```bash
# Full deployment
./master-orchestrator.sh deploy

# Monitor deployment progress
watch kubectl get pods -n pincex-production

# Check deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment/pincex-core-api -n pincex-production
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Generate deployment report
./master-orchestrator.sh report

# Validate all components
./master-orchestrator.sh validate

# Run health checks
curl -f http://<service-endpoint>/health
```

### Step 5: Monitor and Verify
- [ ] All pods are running and ready
- [ ] Health checks are passing
- [ ] Metrics look normal in Grafana
- [ ] No alerts firing in Prometheus
- [ ] Trading functionality working correctly
- [ ] User-facing features operational

## Component-Specific Procedures

### ML Model Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with shadow testing
./master-orchestrator.sh deploy-model price-predictor v2.1.0

# Monitor shadow testing results
tail -f ../logs/shadow-metrics-*.json

# Promote to production if tests pass
./master-orchestrator.sh promote-model price-predictor
```

### Feature Flag Updates
```bash
# Enable new feature gradually
./master-orchestrator.sh toggle-feature new_trading_interface 25

# Monitor user adoption and metrics
# Increase percentage if successful
./master-orchestrator.sh toggle-feature new_trading_interface 50
./master-orchestrator.sh toggle-feature new_trading_interface 100
```

### Multi-Region Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging region first
./multiregion-deployment-v2.sh deploy us-west-1

# Validate region health
./multiregion-deployment-v2.sh health-check us-west-1

# Deploy to all production regions
./master-orchestrator.sh deploy-multiregion
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Watch

#### Application Metrics
- Response time (p95 < 100ms)
- Error rate (< 0.1%)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Active connections

#### Trading Metrics
- Order processing latency (< 10ms)
- Trade settlement time (< 5 seconds)
- Order book update frequency
- Market data latency

#### Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU utilization (< 70%)
- Memory usage (< 80%)
- Disk I/O and storage
- Network throughput

### Alert Thresholds

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Error rate > 5% for 2 minutes
- Response time > 500ms for 5 minutes
- Pod crash loops
- Database connection failures
- Trading engine stopped

#### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 200ms for 10 minutes
- CPU usage > 80% for 15 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% for 10 minutes

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers
The system will automatically rollback if:
- Error rate exceeds 5% for 2 consecutive minutes
- Response time increases by more than 50% for 5 minutes
- Health checks fail for 3 consecutive attempts
- ML model accuracy drops below 85%

### Manual Rollback

#### Full System Rollback
```bash
# Immediate rollback
./master-orchestrator.sh rollback

# Verify rollback completion
kubectl rollout status deployment/pincex-core-api -n pincex-production

# Validate system health
./master-orchestrator.sh validate
```

#### Component-Specific Rollback
```bash
# Rollback ML model
./master-orchestrator.sh rollback-model price-predictor

# Rollback feature flag
./master-orchestrator.sh toggle-feature new_feature false

# Rollback specific region
./multiregion-deployment-v2.sh rollback us-east-1
```

#### Database Rollback (If Required)
```bash
# Stop application traffic
kubectl scale deployment pincex-core-api --replicas=0 -n pincex-production

# Restore database from backup
# (Database-specific procedures)

# Restart application
kubectl scale deployment pincex-core-api --replicas=3 -n pincex-production
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Deployment Stuck
**Symptoms:** Pods stuck in Pending or ContainerCreating state
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n pincex-production
kubectl get events -n pincex-production --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```
**Solutions:**
- Check resource quotas and node capacity
- Verify image pull permissions
- Check persistent volume availability

#### Health Check Failures
**Symptoms:** Pods failing readiness/liveness probes
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n pincex-production
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n pincex-production -- curl localhost:8080/health
```
**Solutions:**
- Check application startup time
- Verify dependencies are available
- Adjust probe timing parameters

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms:** High response times or low throughput
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check resource utilization
kubectl top pods -n pincex-production

# Check application metrics
curl http://<service>/metrics
```
**Solutions:**
- Scale up pods if CPU/memory high
- Check database performance
- Verify network connectivity

#### ML Model Issues
**Symptoms:** Model prediction errors or poor performance
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
./ml-model-deployment-v2.sh status <model-name>
tail -f ../logs/model-deployment-*.log
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify model file integrity
- Check model service connectivity
- Rollback to previous model version

### Emergency Procedures

#### Complete System Failure
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   ```bash
   # Stop accepting new traffic
   kubectl patch service pincex-api -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"app":"maintenance"}}}'
   
   # Scale down problematic components
   kubectl scale deployment pincex-core-api --replicas=0 -n pincex-production
   ```

2. **Diagnostic Steps:**
   - Check cluster node health
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Review application logs
   - Check external service dependencies

3. **Recovery Actions:**
   - Restore from last known good configuration
   - Restart services in dependency order
   - Validate each component before proceeding

#### Data Corruption
1. **Stop all writes immediately**
2. **Assess scope of corruption**
3. **Restore from most recent clean backup**
4. **Replay transactions if possible**
5. **Validate data integrity before resuming**
