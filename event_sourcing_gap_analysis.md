# Event Sourcing Implementation Gap Analysis

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS

#### 1. Event Journal Infrastructure
- **Multiple event journal implementations:**
  - `internal/trading/event_journal.go` - Main event journal with distributed features
  - `internal/trading/eventjournal/event_journal.go` - Basic event journal
  - `internal/trading/eventjournal/file_journal.go` - File-based persistent journal

#### 2. Event Versioning Framework
- **VersionedEvent struct** with schema evolution support
- **EventUpgrader interface** for event migration
- **EventUpgraderRegistry** for version management
- **OrderBookEvent** with versioned payloads
- **ValidatableEvent interface** for event validation

#### 3. Distributed Event Capabilities
- **Kafka integration** for distributed event publishing/consumption
- **Async append** with buffered channels for high-throughput
- **Instance ID tracking** for distributed tracing
- **Coordinator interface** for distributed consensus (stub)

#### 4. WAL (Write-Ahead Log) Features
- **WALRecord with integrity hashing** for data corruption detection
- **Sync/fsync operations** for durability guarantees
- **File rotation and archival** capabilities
- **Metrics tracking** (latency, queue size, rotation counts)

#### 5. Basic Event Types
- ORDER_PLACED, ORDER_CANCELLED, TRADE_EXECUTED, CHECKPOINT
- **OrderPlacedEvent**, **OrderCancelledEvent** with validation

#### 6. Recovery Service Integration
- **RecoveryService** in trading engine with journal integration
- **Basic replay logic** for ORDER_PLACED events

### ‚ùå MISSING COMPONENTS & GAPS

#### 1. Complete Event Replay Implementation
- **ReplayEvents() is NOT implemented** in both journal implementations
- Missing event deserialization and state reconstruction
- No error handling for corrupted events during replay
- No checkpoint-based replay optimization

#### 2. Event Store Management
- **No event archival and retention policies**
- Missing event store cleanup and maintenance
- No event compaction or snapshot capabilities
- Missing distributed storage integration (S3, etc.)

#### 3. Platform-Wide Event Sourcing
- **Bookkeeper service** - Only uses messaging, NO event sourcing
- **Settlement service** - Only XA transactions, NO event sourcing  
- **Wallet service** - Only audit logs, NO event sourcing
- **Missing event types** for financial operations (transfers, settlements, etc.)

#### 4. Advanced Event Features
- **No event correlation and causation tracking**
- Missing event metadata (user context, request ID, etc.)
- No event encryption for sensitive data
- Missing event filtering and subscriptions

#### 5. Event Store Interfaces
- **EventStore interface incomplete** - missing key methods:
  - `GetEvents(fromSequence, toSequence)` 
  - `GetEventsByTimeRange(from, to)`
  - `CreateSnapshot(aggregateId, state)`
  - `GetLatestSnapshot(aggregateId)`

#### 6. Event Migration & Upgrades
- **No migration testing framework**
- Missing rollback capabilities for failed migrations
- No validation of event schema compatibility

#### 7. Monitoring & Observability
- **Missing event store health checks**
- No event processing metrics (throughput, latency per event type)
- Missing alerting for event journal failures

## GAPS BY PRIORITY

### üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS (Blocking Event Sourcing)
1. **Complete ReplayEvents() implementation**
2. **Apply event sourcing to Bookkeeper service** (financial operations)
3. **Apply event sourcing to Settlement service** (trade settlement)
4. **Implement missing EventStore interface methods**

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY GAPS
5. **Event store management** (retention, archival, cleanup)
6. **Event correlation and metadata tracking**
7. **Platform-wide event type definitions**

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS  
8. **Event migration testing framework**
9. **Enhanced monitoring and metrics**
10. **Event encryption for sensitive data**

## NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE EVENT SOURCING

### Step 2: Implement Event Versioning System
- Complete event migration framework
- Add backward compatibility testing
- Implement event schema validation

### Step 3: Build Event Replay Capabilities
- Implement complete ReplayEvents() logic
- Add checkpoint-based replay optimization
- Error handling for corrupted events

### Step 4: Event Store Management
- Implement retention and archival policies  
- Add event store maintenance operations
- Distributed storage integration

### Step 5: Apply Event Sourcing Platform-Wide
- Integrate event sourcing into Bookkeeper service
- Integrate event sourcing into Settlement service  
- Integrate event sourcing into Wallet service
- Define comprehensive event types

### Step 6: Integration and Testing
- End-to-end event sourcing tests
- Performance benchmarking
- Disaster recovery testing

## ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Event Store Interface
```go
type EventStore interface {
    // Core operations
    AppendEvent(event VersionedEvent) error
    GetEvents(aggregateID string, fromSequence, toSequence int64) ([]VersionedEvent, error)
    GetEventsByTimeRange(from, to time.Time) ([]VersionedEvent, error)
    
    // Replay operations  
    ReplayAllVersioned(handler func(VersionedEvent) error) error
    ReplayFromCheckpoint(checkpointID string, handler func(VersionedEvent) error) error
    
    // Snapshot operations
    CreateSnapshot(aggregateID string, sequence int64, state interface{}) error
    GetLatestSnapshot(aggregateID string) (*Snapshot, error)
    
    // Management operations
    CreateCheckpoint(id string) error
    ArchiveEvents(beforeTime time.Time) error
    GetMetrics() EventStoreMetrics
}
```

### Event Types to Add
```go
// Financial operations
const (
    EventTypeFundsTransfer     = "FUNDS_TRANSFER"
    EventTypeFundsLocked       = "FUNDS_LOCKED" 
    EventTypeFundsUnlocked     = "FUNDS_UNLOCKED"
    EventTypeAccountCreated    = "ACCOUNT_CREATED"
    EventTypeSettlementCleared = "SETTLEMENT_CLEARED"
    EventTypePositionNetted    = "POSITION_NETTED"
)
```

This analysis shows that while the foundation for event sourcing is solid, critical gaps remain in replay implementation and platform-wide application.
